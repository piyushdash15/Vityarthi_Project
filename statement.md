Statement of the Project
1. Problem Statement
Weak and predictable passwords are one of the most common causes of security breaches.

Users frequently choose passwords that are easy to guess, contain repeated characters, or follow well-known patterns such as “12345”, “password”, “qwerty”, etc.
There is a need for an intelligent tool that can:

1) Evaluate passwords in real-time.
2) Identify weak or risky patterns
3) Measure actual password strength using entropy
4) Provide improvement suggestions to guide users toward stronger and more secure passwords

This project aims to solve the above issues through a Smart Password Strength Checker application built using Python and Tkinter.

3. Scope of the Project
The scope of this project includes:

1) Designing a GUI-based password evaluation tool
2) Implementing password scoring using length, character diversity, entropy, and pattern detection
3) Real-time analysis using Tkinter event handling
4)Providing clear visual feedback through a strength meter
5) Displaying actionable suggestions for improving weak passwords
6) Ensuring the system is lightweight, offline, and easy to use

Not included in scope (but possible for future updates):
1) Cloud-based breach detection
2) Database integration
3) Multi-user management
4) Mobile/Android version

3. Target Users

This project is designed for:

✔ Students & Learners

who want to understand password security, entropy, and GUI development in Python.

✔ General Computer Users

who want to test and improve the strength of their passwords before using them online.

✔ Developers

who want to integrate a password-checking module into their own applications.

✔ Educational Institutions

for teaching cybersecurity fundamentals.

4. High-Level Features

The Smart Password Checker provides the following key features:

🔹 Real-time Password Analysis

Evaluates password strength instantly as the user types.

🔹 Entropy Calculation

Calculates the entropy (in bits) of the password to measure randomness.

🔹 Weak Pattern Detection

Detects common insecure patterns such as:

"password"

"qwerty"

"12345"

"letmein", etc.

🔹 Character Diversity Scoring

Checks for:

Lowercase letters

Uppercase letters

Numbers

Special symbols

🔹 Visual Strength Meter

A color-coded bar representing password strength from Very Weak to Very Strong.

🔹 Improvement Suggestions

Provides tailored suggestions such as:

1) Add special characters

2) Increase length

3) Avoid repetition

4) Improve entropy

🔹 Simple and Clean GUI

Uses Tkinter for a lightweight graphical interface.
